His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man, through the dapper and very successful portrait-painter of the 1630s, to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his old age.

Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt \"a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life\".<ref>Durham, p. 60.</ref>\\n\\nAmong the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt\\'s work are his use of [[chiaroscuro]], the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from [[Caravaggio]], or, more likely, from the Dutch [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]] but adapted for very personal means.<ref>Bull, et al., pp. 11–13.</ref> Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age.

For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself. Rembrandt must have realized that if he kept the paint deliberately loose and \"paint-like\" on some parts of the canvas, the perception of space became much greater.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref> \\n\\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt\\'s skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\\n\\nLastman\\'s influence on Rembrandt was most prominent during his period in Leiden from 1625 to 1631.<ref name=\"Wetering-284\">van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry). Religious and [[allegory|allegorical]] themes were favored, as were [[tronie]]s.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1626 Rembrandt produced his first etchings, the wide dissemination of which would largely account for his international fame.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1629 he completed \\'\\'[[Judas Repentant, Returning the Pieces of Silver]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Artist in his studio|The Artist in His Studio]]\\'\\', works that evidence his interest in the handling of light and variety of paint application, and constitute the first major progress in his development as a painter.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 285.</ref>\\n\\nDuring his early years in Amsterdam (1632–1636), Rembrandt began to paint dramatic biblical and mythological scenes in high contrast and of large format (\\'\\'[[The Blinding of Samson]]\\'\\', 1636, \\'\\'[[Belshazzar\\'s Feast (Rembrandt)|Belshazzar\\'s Feast]]\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1635 \\'\\'[[Danaë (Rembrandt)|Danaë]]\\'\\', 1636 but reworked later), seeking to emulate the baroque style of [[Rubens]].<ref>van de Wetering, p. 287.</ref> With the occasional help of assistants in Uylenburgh\\'s workshop, he painted numerous portrait commissions both small ([[Jacob de Gheyn III (painting)|\\'\\'Jacob de Gheyn&nbsp;III\\'\\']]) and large (\\'\\'Portrait of the Shipbuilder Jan Rijcksen and his Wife\\'\\', 1633, \\'\\'[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]\\'\\', 1632).<ref>van de Wetering, p. 286.</ref>\\n\\nBy the late 1630s, Rembrandt had produced a few paintings and many etchings of [[landscape painting|landscapes]]. Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (\\'\\'Cottages before a Stormy Sky\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1641; \\'\\'The Three Trees\\'\\', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted \\'\\'[[The Night Watch]]\\'\\', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\\n\\nIn the decade following the \\'\\'Night Watch\\'\\', Rembrandt\\'s paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (\\'\\'Susanna and the Elders\\'\\', 1637–47).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163–165.</ref>\\nAt the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\\n\\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt\\'s style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of \\'finish\\' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt\\'s brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155–165.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting\\'s surface. The result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 157–158, 190.</ref>\\n\\nIn later years, [[Bible|biblical]] themes were often depicted but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (\\'\\'James the Apostle\\'\\', 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (\\'\\'[[The Jewish Bride]]\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1666)—in love, in life, and before God.<ref>\"In Rembrandt\\'s (late) great portraits we feel face to face with real people, we sense their warmth, their need for sympathy and also their loneliness and suffering. Those keen and steady eyes that we know so well from Rembrandt\\'s self-portraits must have been able to look straight into the human heart.\" Gombrich, p. 423.</ref><ref>\"It (\\'\\'The Jewish Bride\\'\\') is a picture of grown-up love, a marvelous amalgam of richness, tenderness, and trust... the heads which, in their truth, have a spiritual glow that painters influenced by the classical tradition could never achieve.\" Clark, p. 206.</ref>\\n\\n===Graphic works===\\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Christ with the Sick around Him, Receiving Little Children (The \\'Hundred Guilder Print\\') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The \\'\\'[[Hundred Guilder Print]]\\'\\' (c. 1647–49), an etching now housed in the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo]]\\n[[File:Die landschaft mit den drei baeumen.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'The Three Trees\\'\\' (1643)]]\\n[[File:B159 Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|The Shell (a [[cone snail]]) is the only still life Rembrandt ever etched.]]\\n\\nRembrandt produced [[etching]]s for most of his career, from 1626 to 1660, when he was forced to sell his printing-press and practically abandoned etching.

He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5–6</ref> He worked on the so-called \\'\\'[[Hundred Guilder Print]]\\'\\' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9–10</ref>\\n\\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"[[surface tone]],\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6–7</ref>\\n\\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the 27 self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. The landscapes, mostly small, largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. Of the many hundreds of drawings Rembrandt made, only about two hundred have a landscape motif as their subject, and of the approximately three hundred etchings, about thirty show a landscape. As for his painted landscapes, one does not even get beyond eight works.<ref>\\n\\nChristiaan Vogelaar &  Gregor J.M. Weber (2006) Rembrandts Landschappen</ref> One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints.

After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day—a party of 18 [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight. For [[Théophile Thoré]] it was the prettiest painting in the world. \\n\\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the \\'\\'[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]\\'\\', the musketeer branch of the [[schutterij|civic militia]]. Rembrandt departed from convention, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal, rather a line-up than an action scene. Instead he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission, though the exact nature of the mission or event is a matter of ongoing debate.\\n\\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Amsterdam town hall]] in 1715. In 1817 this large painting was moved to the [[Trippenhuis]]. Since 1885 the painting is on display at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]].{{Efn|The Rijksmuseum has a smaller copy of what is thought to be the full original composition.<!--the four figures in the front are at the centre of the canvas?-->}} In 1940 the painting was moved to [[Kasteel Radboud]]; in 1941 to a bunker near [[Heemskerk]]; in 1942 to [[St Pietersberg]]; in June 1945 it was shipped back to Amsterdam.\\n\\n==Expert assessments==\\n{{see also|Rembrandt catalog raisonné, 1968}}\\n[[File:Rembrandt - De Poolse ruiter, c.1655 (Frick Collection).jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'[[The Polish Rider]]\\'\\' (c. 1655) is possibly a [[Lisowczycy|Lisowczyk]] on horseback.]]\\n[[File:Mann mit dem Goldhelm.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'[[The Man with the Golden Helmet]]\\'\\', now housed in [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] in Berlin, was considered one of the most famous Rembrandt portraits but is no longer attributed to the master.<ref>{{Cite news |last=John Russell |date=1 December 1985 |title=Art View; In Search of the Real Thing |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/arts/art-view-in-search-of-the-real-thing.html |access-date=12 February 2017 |archive-date=1 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701071518/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/01/arts/art-view-in-search-of-the-real-thing.html |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\\nIn 1968, the Rembrandt Research Project began under the sponsorship of the Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Scientific Research; it was initially expected to last a highly optimistic ten years. Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonné]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future |url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |access-date=11 August 2014 |archive-date=22 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822083100/http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\\n\\nOne example of activity is \\'\\'[[The Polish Rider]]\\'\\', now housed in the [[Frick Collection]] in [[New York City]]. Rembrandt\\'s authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt\\'s closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn\\'s remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost\\'s authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick; In his 1999 book \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\', [[Simon Schama]] and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both argued for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt\\'s authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the \\'Lisowczyk\\' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., \\'\\'Artibus et Historiae\\'\\', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197–205.

There is a book on the subject:\\'\\'Responses to Rembrandt; Who painted the Polish Rider?\\'\\' by Anthony Bailey (New York, 1993)</ref>\\n\\nA similar issue was raised by Schama concerning the verification of titles associated with the subject matter depicted in Rembrandt\\'s works. For example, the exact subject being portrayed in \\'\\'[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]\\'\\', recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum, has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\'. Knopf, p. 720.</ref> Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]] who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.<ref>Schama, pp. 582–591.</ref>\\n\\nAnother painting, \\'\\'Pilate Washing His Hands\\'\\', is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master\\'s command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |access-date=1 January 2015 |publisher=Outpost Art |archive-date=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112111138/http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing.

Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate. Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt\\'s own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments.<ref>\"...Rembrandt was not always the perfectly consistent, logical Dutchman he was originally anticipated to be.\" Ackley, p. 13.</ref> As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.<ref>van de Wetering, p. x.</ref> It is highly likely that there will never be universal agreement as to what does and what does not constitute a genuine Rembrandt.\\n{{Further|Man in a Plumed Beret}}\\n\\n==Painting materials==\\n[[File:Rembrandt - Saskia van Uylenburgh in Arcadian Costume - WGA19164.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'Saskia as Flora\\'\\' (1635)]]\\n\\nTechnical investigation of Rembrandt\\'s paintings in the possession of the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]]<ref>Kühn, Hermann. \\'Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgründen Rembrandts, durchgeführt an den Gemälden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden\\'(Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden), Maltechnik/Restauro, issue 4 (1977): 223–233</ref> and in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]<ref>Kühn, Hermann. \\'Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgründen Rembrandts, durchgeführt an den Gemälden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel\\' (Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel), Maltechnik/Restauro, volume 82 (1976): 25–33</ref> was conducted by Hermann Kühn in 1977.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\" but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\".

The great shadow of the old master required a decided attitude. A late [[Romantic painting|Romantic painter]] and critic, like [[Eugène Fromentin|Fromentin]] was, if he happened not to like some of Rembrandt\\'s pictures, he felt obliged to justify his feeling. The greatness of the dramatic old master was for artists of about 1875 not a matter for doubt. \\'Either I am wrong\\', Fromentin wrote from Holland \\'or everybody else is wrong\\'. When Fromentin realized his inability to like some of the works by Rembrandt he formulated the following comments: \\'I even do not dare to write down such a blasphemy; I would get ridiculed if this is disclosed\\'. Only about twenty-five years earlier another French Romantic master [[Eugène Delacroix]], when expressing his admiration for Rembrandt, has written in his \\'\\'Journal\\'\\' a very different statement: \\'... perhaps one day we will discover that Rembrandt is a much greater painter than [[Raphael]]. It is a blasphemy which would make hair raise on the heads of all the academic painters\\'. In 1851 the blasphemy was to put Rembrandt above Raphael. In 1875 the blasphemy was not to admire everything Rembrandt had ever produced. Between these two dates, the appreciation of Rembrandt reached its turning point and since that time he was never deprived of the high rank in the art world.|200px||Rembrandt scholar [[Jan Białostocki]] (1972)<ref name=\"Białostocki\">[[Jan Białostocki|Białostocki, Jan]] (1972), \\'Rembrandt and Posterity,\\'.

His oil paintings trace the progress from an uncertain young man, through the dapper and very successful portrait-painter of the 1630s, to the troubled but massively powerful portraits of his old age. Together they give a remarkably clear picture of the man, his appearance and his psychological make-up, as revealed by his richly weathered face.{{efn|While the popular interpretation is that these paintings represent a personal and introspective journey, it is possible that they were painted to satisfy a market for self-portraits by prominent artists. Van de Wetering, p. 290.}}\\n\\nIn his portraits and self-portraits, he angles the sitter\\'s face in such a way that the ridge of the nose nearly always forms the line of demarcation between brightly illuminated and shadowy areas. A Rembrandt face is a face partially eclipsed; and the nose, bright and obvious, thrusting into the riddle of halftones, serves to focus the viewer\\'s attention upon, and to dramatize, the division between a flood of light—an overwhelming clarity—and a brooding duskiness.<ref>Taylor, Michael (2007).[http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html Rembrandt\\'s Nose: Of Flesh & Spirit in the Master\\'s Portraits] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505200753/http://www.artbook.com/1933045442.html |date=5 May 2016 }} p. 21, D.A.P./Distributed Art Publishers, Inc., New York {{ISBN|978-1933045443}}\\'</ref>\\n\\nIn a number of biblical works, including \\'\\'The Raising of the Cross\\'\\', \\'\\'Joseph Telling His Dreams\\'\\', and \\'\\'[[The Stoning of Saint Stephen]]\\'\\', Rembrandt painted himself as a character in the crowd. Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt \"a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life\".<ref>Durham, p. 60.</ref>\\n\\nAmong the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt\\'s work are his use of [[chiaroscuro]], the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from [[Caravaggio]], or, more likely, from the Dutch [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]] but adapted for very personal means.<ref>Bull, et al., pp. 11–13.</ref> Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age. His immediate family—his wife Saskia, his son Titus and his common-law wife Hendrickje—often figured prominently in his paintings, many of which had [[mythology|mythical]], biblical or historical themes.\\n\\n===Periods, themes and styles===\\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - The Abduction of Europa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[The Abduction of Europa (Rembrandt)|\\'\\'The Abduction of Europa\\'\\']] (1632) has been described as \"...a shining example of the \\'golden age\\' of [[Baroque]] painting\".<ref>Clough, p. 23</ref>]]\\n[[File:Rembrandt, Portret van Haesje v.Cleyburg 1634.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Portrait of Haesje Jacobsdr. van Cleyburg from Rotterdam (1634) completed during the height of his commercial success]] [[File:Rembrandt van Rijn (Leiden 1606-Amsterdam 1669) - Self-Portrait in a Flat Cap - RCIN 404120 - Royal Collection.jpg|thumb|Rembrandt van Rijn – Self-Portrait with a flat cap (1642) Royal Collection]]\\n[[File:Rembrandt - Zelfportret - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'Self Portrait\\'\\' (1658), now housed in the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City, has been described as \"the calmest and grandest of all his portraits\"<ref>Clark 1978, p. 28</ref>]]\\n\\nThroughout his career, Rembrandt took as his primary subjects the themes of portraiture, landscape and narrative painting. For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself. Rembrandt must have realized that if he kept the paint deliberately loose and \"paint-like\" on some parts of the canvas, the perception of space became much greater.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref> \\n\\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt\\'s skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\\n\\nLastman\\'s influence on Rembrandt was most prominent during his period in Leiden from 1625 to 1631.<ref name=\"Wetering-284\">van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry). Religious and [[allegory|allegorical]] themes were favored, as were [[tronie]]s.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1626 Rembrandt produced his first etchings, the wide dissemination of which would largely account for his international fame.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1629 he completed \\'\\'[[Judas Repentant, Returning the Pieces of Silver]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Artist in his studio|The Artist in His Studio]]\\'\\', works that evidence his interest in the handling of light and variety of paint application, and constitute the first major progress in his development as a painter.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 285.</ref>\\n\\nDuring his early years in Amsterdam (1632–1636), Rembrandt began to paint dramatic biblical and mythological scenes in high contrast and of large format (\\'\\'[[The Blinding of Samson]]\\'\\', 1636, \\'\\'[[Belshazzar\\'s Feast (Rembrandt)|Belshazzar\\'s Feast]]\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1635 \\'\\'[[Danaë (Rembrandt)|Danaë]]\\'\\', 1636 but reworked later), seeking to emulate the baroque style of [[Rubens]].<ref>van de Wetering, p. 287.</ref> With the occasional help of assistants in Uylenburgh\\'s workshop, he painted numerous portrait commissions both small ([[Jacob de Gheyn III (painting)|\\'\\'Jacob de Gheyn&nbsp;III\\'\\']]) and large (\\'\\'Portrait of the Shipbuilder Jan Rijcksen and his Wife\\'\\', 1633, \\'\\'[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]\\'\\', 1632).<ref>van de Wetering, p. 286.</ref>\\n\\nBy the late 1630s, Rembrandt had produced a few paintings and many etchings of [[landscape painting|landscapes]]. Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (\\'\\'Cottages before a Stormy Sky\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1641; \\'\\'The Three Trees\\'\\', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted \\'\\'[[The Night Watch]]\\'\\', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\\n\\nIn the decade following the \\'\\'Night Watch\\'\\', Rembrandt\\'s paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (\\'\\'Susanna and the Elders\\'\\', 1637–47).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163–165.</ref>\\nAt the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\\n\\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt\\'s style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of \\'finish\\' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt\\'s brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155–165.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting\\'s surface. The result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 157–158, 190.</ref>\\n\\nIn later years, [[Bible|biblical]] themes were often depicted but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (\\'\\'James the Apostle\\'\\', 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (\\'\\'[[The Jewish Bride]]\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1666)—in love, in life, and before God.<ref>\"In Rembrandt\\'s (late) great portraits we feel face to face with real people, we sense their warmth, their need for sympathy and also their loneliness and suffering. Those keen and steady eyes that we know so well from Rembrandt\\'s self-portraits must have been able to look straight into the human heart.\" Gombrich, p. 423.</ref><ref>\"It (\\'\\'The Jewish Bride\\'\\') is a picture of grown-up love, a marvelous amalgam of richness, tenderness, and trust... the heads which, in their truth, have a spiritual glow that painters influenced by the classical tradition could never achieve.\" Clark, p. 206.</ref>\\n\\n===Graphic works===\\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Christ with the Sick around Him, Receiving Little Children (The \\'Hundred Guilder Print\\') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The \\'\\'[[Hundred Guilder Print]]\\'\\' (c. 1647–49), an etching now housed in the [[National Museum of Western Art]] in Tokyo]]\\n[[File:Die landschaft mit den drei baeumen.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'The Three Trees\\'\\' (1643)]]\\n[[File:B159 Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|The Shell (a [[cone snail]]) is the only still life Rembrandt ever etched.]]\\n\\nRembrandt produced [[etching]]s for most of his career, from 1626 to 1660, when he was forced to sell his printing-press and practically abandoned etching. Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<ref>Schwartz, 1994, pp. 8–12</ref> He took easily to etching and, though he learned to use a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and partly [[engraving|engraved]] many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5–6</ref> He worked on the so-called \\'\\'[[Hundred Guilder Print]]\\'\\' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9–10</ref>\\n\\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"[[surface tone]],\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6–7</ref>\\n\\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the 27 self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. The landscapes, mostly small, largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. Of the many hundreds of drawings Rembrandt made, only about two hundred have a landscape motif as their subject, and of the approximately three hundred etchings, about thirty show a landscape. As for his painted landscapes, one does not even get beyond eight works.<ref>\\n\\nChristiaan Vogelaar &  Gregor J.M. Weber (2006) Rembrandts Landschappen</ref> One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints. A few erotic, or just obscene, compositions have no equivalent in his paintings.<ref>See Schwartz, 1994, where the works are divided by subject, following [[Adam Bartsch|Bartsch]].</ref> He owned, until forced to sell it, a magnificent collection of prints by other artists, and many borrowings and influences in his work can be traced to artists as diverse as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Hercules Seghers]], and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].\\n\\nDrawings by Rembrandt and [[list of Rembrandt pupils|his pupils/followers]] have been extensively studied by many artists and scholars{{efn|Such as [[Otto Benesch]],<ref>Benesch, Otto: \\'\\'The Drawings of Rembrandt: First Complete Edition in Six Volumes\\'\\'.

After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day—a party of 18 [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight. For [[Théophile Thoré]] it was the prettiest painting in the world. \\n\\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the \\'\\'[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]\\'\\', the musketeer branch of the [[schutterij|civic militia]]. Rembrandt departed from convention, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal, rather a line-up than an action scene. Instead he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission, though the exact nature of the mission or event is a matter of ongoing debate.\\n\\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Amsterdam town hall]] in 1715. In 1817 this large painting was moved to the [[Trippenhuis]].

Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonné]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future |url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |access-date=11 August 2014 |archive-date=22 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822083100/http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\\n\\nOne example of activity is \\'\\'[[The Polish Rider]]\\'\\', now housed in the [[Frick Collection]] in [[New York City]]. Rembrandt\\'s authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt\\'s closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn\\'s remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost\\'s authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick; In his 1999 book \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\', [[Simon Schama]] and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both argued for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt\\'s authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the \\'Lisowczyk\\' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., \\'\\'Artibus et Historiae\\'\\', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197–205.

There is a book on the subject:\\'\\'Responses to Rembrandt; Who painted the Polish Rider?\\'\\' by Anthony Bailey (New York, 1993)</ref>\\n\\nA similar issue was raised by Schama concerning the verification of titles associated with the subject matter depicted in Rembrandt\\'s works. For example, the exact subject being portrayed in \\'\\'[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]\\'\\', recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum, has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\'. Knopf, p. 720.</ref> Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]] who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.<ref>Schama, pp. 582–591.</ref>\\n\\nAnother painting, \\'\\'Pilate Washing His Hands\\'\\', is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master\\'s command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |access-date=1 January 2015 |publisher=Outpost Art |archive-date=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112111138/http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing.

Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate. Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt\\'s own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments.<ref>\"...Rembrandt was not always the perfectly consistent, logical Dutchman he was originally anticipated to be.\" Ackley, p. 13.</ref> As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.<ref>van de Wetering, p. x.</ref> It is highly likely that there will never be universal agreement as to what does and what does not constitute a genuine Rembrandt.\\n{{Further|Man in a Plumed Beret}}\\n\\n==Painting materials==\\n[[File:Rembrandt - Saskia van Uylenburgh in Arcadian Costume - WGA19164.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\\'\\'Saskia as Flora\\'\\' (1635)]]\\n\\nTechnical investigation of Rembrandt\\'s paintings in the possession of the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]]<ref>Kühn, Hermann. \\'Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgründen Rembrandts, durchgeführt an den Gemälden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden\\'(Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden), Maltechnik/Restauro, issue 4 (1977): 223–233</ref> and in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]<ref>Kühn, Hermann. \\'Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgründen Rembrandts, durchgeführt an den Gemälden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel\\' (Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel), Maltechnik/Restauro, volume 82 (1976): 25–33</ref> was conducted by Hermann Kühn in 1977.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\" but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\".

This change is purely visual; it does not change the way his name is pronounced. Curiously enough, despite the large number of paintings and etchings signed with this modified first name, most of the documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original \"Rembrant\" spelling.

The great shadow of the old master required a decided attitude. A late [[Romantic painting|Romantic painter]] and critic, like [[Eugène Fromentin|Fromentin]] was, if he happened not to like some of Rembrandt\\'s pictures, he felt obliged to justify his feeling. The greatness of the dramatic old master was for artists of about 1875 not a matter for doubt. \\'Either I am wrong\\', Fromentin wrote from Holland \\'or everybody else is wrong\\'. When Fromentin realized his inability to like some of the works by Rembrandt he formulated the following comments: \\'I even do not dare to write down such a blasphemy; I would get ridiculed if this is disclosed\\'. Only about twenty-five years earlier another French Romantic master [[Eugène Delacroix]], when expressing his admiration for Rembrandt, has written in his \\'\\'Journal\\'\\' a very different statement: \\'... perhaps one day we will discover that Rembrandt is a much greater painter than [[Raphael]]. It is a blasphemy which would make hair raise on the heads of all the academic painters\\'. In 1851 the blasphemy was to put Rembrandt above Raphael. In 1875 the blasphemy was not to admire everything Rembrandt had ever produced. Between these two dates, the appreciation of Rembrandt reached its turning point and since that time he was never deprived of the high rank in the art world.|200px||Rembrandt scholar [[Jan Białostocki]] (1972)<ref name=\"Białostocki\">[[Jan Białostocki|Białostocki, Jan]] (1972), \\'Rembrandt and Posterity,\\'.
